                <ul>
                  <li>This is a guide for all 5* demons in the game when you want to fuse them/archetype change. </li>
                  <li>Its focus is in analyzing and discussing what are good/bad archetypes
                      and is based on looking at their kit + how the playerbase generally builds them.</li>
                  <li>There may be people who have better opinions than mine as I don't have that many 5* demons.</li>
                  <li>For Gacha demons, i'll go over their gacha skills as the only way to obtain them is via pulling</li>
                  <li>Standard 5*s are analyzed on the basis of the archetype skill only, for when you want to fuse them/switch archetype</li>

                    <p>Highest grade demon with the unique skill Fire Of Sinai (FoS). FoS hits really hard with
                        guaranteed 5 hits (+1 if you're using Eileen enabling you to activate her skills),
                        and so quite amazing for boss killing. He comes naturally to boot with Infinite Chakra for
                        extra mana so you
                        would be able to spam tons of spells with him without needing divine brands. He's the hardest
                        to fuse as the only
                        combination to make him is Vishnu + Barong and for this reason i wouldn't fuse him away
                        (regardless of his archetype,
                        his base kit works wonders).

                                  You can easily stack this with Endure to make him really hard to kill.

                                  <br>This archetype is the hardest to obtain as you can't rely on gacha
                                  pulls to get components
                                  and must fuse from scratch (Unless you get lucky with Hell Buns).

                                  to then follow up, hitting as hard as possible.

                                  <br> Pair Metatron with Alilat and you can block elec sweeping. Its a

                                  really warrant switching to Teal just for that purpose. </td>

                        <li>Serial Killer/Butcher. Not only does it affect Aoe skills, it also affects Multi-Hit,
                            so you can power up Fire of Sinai's damage considerably.

                        powerful as he can get. The reason for this is that he comes with the unique skill: Morning
                        Star (MS). Given the fact it can be levelled as well it can reach really high numbers.

                        if you maxed it out), though the less opponents alive, the less effective it'll be in returning

                    <p>Mot is a tanky caster coming with Megidolaon, Mamudodyne and Harmonius Death, a really useful passive (Every second turn he gains 
                       10% damage (cap = 50%) and an extra press turn). Naturally he repels Force and Dark, meaning if you pair him up with Alilat you can prevent 
                       Cu Chulainn + Black Frost sweeps. Given his unique passive, stats and the fact he also resists 
                       phys and fire he's a really good defensive demon in pve and pvp content. The longer he's left alive, the more 
                       dangerous the enemy team becomes. Note it takes two turns for a 10% jump and so it'd take 10 
                       turns to reach 50%. This is unlikely to be reached in pvp but in pve content such as Kiwami this can prove quite useful depending on who

                       This is because of her unique skill Repel Pierce, ignoring the pierce effect on units that repel the attribute. 
                       She is easy/cheap to fuse, has no weaknesses and really high luck + Infernal Mask meaning she can inflict ailments quite well and be 
                       unlikely to be inflicted herself. Due to this you have a lot of freedom in picking how you want to build her, whether a debuffer, ailment caster, 
                       or even a healer role from what i've seen.</p>

                    <p>The opposite of a tanky demon as instead of surviving as long as possible she'd prefer to die for me due to her unique passive Yaxche. 
                        This activates only on the enemy turn as when she dies: her killer is hit by an almighty attack and is killed with a 100%
                        success rate (same effect as White Rider/Alice). This bypasses Endure/Avatar/Enduring Soul, but doesn't activate if her team is wiped out/she's the last to die. 
                        On offense you can easily exploit the game's AI to target her by intentionally leaving her at level 1, or having the least 
                        defense/hp/mdef so they're tempted to kill her straight away.</p>

                                <li>Use ailments on her/her team. Poison can kill her without worry of her passive,
                                    charm can force her allies to kill her.</li>
                                <li>Bring Reiko as you'd probably expect them to use Recarm a lot. This will ensure
                                    Ixtab's ability only activates once as she should be easily killable </li>

                    <p>The only source of Fire Pierce, but not that good of a demon as a fire weakness isn't that
                        prevalent. He's mainly seen either with a purple archetype for Fire Pierce or Clear for
                        Intimidating Stance. He comes with a unique skill Ragnarok which is another single target
                        sniping skill (getting 20% damage based on Phys Attack). It will take a lot of investment, but you can get Ragnarok
                        to rain down the norse apocalypse on enemies (It's one of the most powerful skills in the game, 215 base power). With brands 
                        prioritized towards Matk %, Phys% secondaries, a maxed out Ragnarok (5 Kasanes required), you can reach pretty high numbers with him.

                    <p>Demon designed and built for tankiness with two unique abilities centering around weaknesses: Law of Hell prevents the enemy team 
                       from getting extra press turn icons when a weakness is hit, whilst Hell's Gate grants damage reduction depending on the number of weak 
                       attributes your team has (3% per weakness, max 30%). Naturally he comes with War Cry for debuffing and 2 weaknesses himself, meaning by 
                       default you get a 6% damage reduction bonus (though this applies only to aoe/multi-target skills). Pairing him with Hecatoncheires would grant 
                       you an extra 15% damage reduction and if you don't cover Hecaton's weakness then in total they share 27% damage reduction. 
                       So if you do cap out on damage reduction (by bringing demons such as Slime, Abraxas, Arahabaki, etc) this brings it up to a total of 45% essentially halving all 
                       damage done. With this strat however, single target skills will still do standard damage to you.</p>

                            don't have to bring a buffer unit. There's also the chance of getting extra press turns</li>

                    <p><strong>Brands:</strong> Divine since we want to be sweeping as quickly as possible. This will allow you to turn 1 Megido in pvp. 
                        Go for Spell Type if you wanna use him for Vanity 10 (you can then go with Mamudo). 
                        Building evasion is another way to go as aforementioned.

                    <p>Along with Barong she's another 5* which is not so good. She has two weaknesses meaning you'd
                       need to cover them (and she'd be costly to invest into). She comes with a unique skill Allure
                       that does dark damage to all and has a 35% chance to charm, this would be pretty good if only
                       there weren't so many enemies immune to dark. Her pretty high luck means the charm would
                       probably stick if enemies are hit, but with such a low base chance it doesn't help that much.
