                        </strong></p>
                    <p>Highest grade demon with the unique skill Fire Of Sinai (FoS). FoS hits really hard with
                        guaranteed 5 hits (+1 if you're using Eileen enabling you to activate her skills),
                        and so quite amazing for boss killing. He comes naturally to boot with Infinite Chakra for
                        extra mana so you
                        would be able to spam tons of spells with him without needing divine brands. He's the hardest
                        to fuse as the only
                        combination to make him is Vishnu + Barong and for this reason i wouldn't fuse him away
                        (regardless of his archetype,
                        his base kit works wonders).

                                            and must fuse from scratch (Unless you get lucky with Hell Buns).

                        Star (MS). Given the fact it can be levelled as well it can reach really high numbers.

                        other pierce users in the game, Purple is his best archetype. He also comes with Null Bind
                        (meh) and Titanomachia for sweeping so enemies will fall quite quickly to him.</p>

                    <p>A really strong magical demon with good survivability as well. She utilizes the unique skill
                        Yomotsu Okami which, as long as she's alive Elec and Dark attacks do 10% more damage for
                        all
                        party members. This means she's useful for setups with demons such as Purple Thor (Elec
                        pierce)
                        and Black Frost (Go To Hell! has dark pierce attached to it). Even without them, she
                        herself
                        comes with Bolt Storm and Merciless blow meaning if you face a elec weak demon they'd get

                        <li>All of her Archetypes are pretty good i'd say, the only one that's iffy to me is
                            Teal(Repel
                            Ice). Since she already nulls ice, the only use this will get is pairing her up with
                            Alilat
                            to ignore ice pierce. Though the only situation that this will be useful is if you face
                            a
                            Purple Rama which would be quite rare anyways.</li>
                        <li>Clear (Life Surge). You can increase her tankiness with this, though this'll be the
                            hardest
                            to get unless you're really luck with hell buns or have tons of mag to fuse clear 5*
                            demons.</li>
                        <li>Red (Hell Gaze). Goes well with her unique passive and is quite powerful too, 180 power
                            will hit hard.</li>
                        <li>Yellow (Concentrate). Enables you to turn her into a sweeper if you like. Though if you
                            want to cover her weakness you'd only be able to pick one additional skill.</li>
                        <li>Purple (Elec Amp). Boosts her elec damage even further.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Elec Boost. Goes well with Elec Amp, though if you take resist as well you'd be

                    <p><strong>Brands:</strong> Magic type is fine since Bolt Storm doesn't cost much. Hell Gaze
                        will
                        cost 6mp, go with Divine if you want to use it off the bat in pvp.

                    <p>Dark oriented unit with Mamudoon, Mudodyne and her unique Die for Me! (Kills a single enemy,
                        one use only). Yup, she can kill anyone she points her finger at (provided they aren't
                        immune to dark/boss as they are immune). She's really good for shutting down dangerous
                        opponents and can hit hard provided no dark immunity as that's all her base kit relies on.</p>
                    <p><strong>Best Archetype(s): </strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Yellow gives her a unique skill (Necro Dogma + Epic Recovery), though given its cost
                            (9mp -&gt; 8) and effect (Almighty damage 100 to all enemies + Rakukaja), it isn't that
                            good as its a weak Megidolaon. Epic Recovery is sadly meh (its a rare skill and she's
                            the only source of it, in case you are interested in it). The main appeal with this
                            Archetype is that is gives her more of a supportive role, also saving you from
                            transferring Megido, so you can go with Resist Light + whatever you want. You'd want to
                            run Divine in order to be able to 2 turn Necro Dogma.</li>
                        <li>Purple (Dark Amp + Wild Instinct). Makes all of her dark skills hit even harder, Wild
                            Instinct is pretty crappy i'd recommend removing it.</li>
                        <li>Teal (Repel Light + Thunder Reign). Covers her light weakness and gives her an
                            alternate source of attack. Thunder Reign is quite powerful so it'll capitalize on her
                            high magic stat.</li>

                        + granting him Phys pierce (!!!) and Yinlong Killer, a sweeping phys skill which adds 50%
                        crit with 150 power. With that skillset he's quite devastating in any content and this is
                        probably why (him + Hell Biker + Zaou Gongen), you see a lot of anti-phys defense teams in
                        pvp.</p>
                    <p><strong>Best Archetype(s): </strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All are good due to him having amazing gacha skills. If you wanted to archetype change
                            with him though, then either go with Purple for Null Charm (Pvp as charm is widely
                            used) or Teal for Repel Light (Covers for Hecatoncheires' Light weakness when facing
                            light sweeping demons like Mastema). So i'll just go over each archetype and why it
                            works</li>
                        <li>Red (Berserker God + Auto-Taruka). Auto taruka is what makes this really nice, saves
                            you using another demon with it though if you have Ananta this archetype isn't that
                            good. Berserker God is good at taking out single targets but his main use is in
                            sweeping anyhows</li>
                        <li>Yellow (Salvation + Null Phys). Salvation is not that good on him as he is not a
                            caster, Null Phys is what makes this pulled archetype good (and is the only source of a
                            Null resistance that is transferable). If his attack is repelled he won't die to the
                            reflected damage so you can sweep teams using Alilat + repel phys.</li>
                        <li>Purple (Null Charm + Serial Killer). Immunity to charm is amazing in pvp as mentioned
                            before (so you won't sweep your own kill). Having Serial Killer will boost his aoe
                            damage even further.</li>
                        <li>Teal (Repel Light + Infernal Mask). Immunity to light also means you can't be one
                            shotted by God's Bow, whilst Infernal Mask ensures he's unlikely to be hit by ailments
                            in the first place.</li>

                    <p><strong>Brands:</strong> War to maximise his damage or Divine if you want to pull off turn 1
                        Hades Blast and have 2 turn Yinlong Killer spamming. People sometimes go with Life too to
                        ensure he's bulky. You wouldn't really need Ward as Purple or pulled Teal though it can act
                        as a safety harness. In that case Aim would be nice against evasion teams or Shield for
                        magic defense.</p>

                    <p>One of the best support demons in the game (I want him &gt;-&lt;). His main use is for Five
                        Elements which is a improved version of Makarakarn, reflecting all spells including
                        Almighty ones. Only pierce skills/phys attacks can be used. Regardless of the archetype, i
                        would recommend getting him as 5 Elements will make content much easier.</p>

                        <li>Purple (Speedster). If you really need more speed, then he's your guy, with his
                            naturally high speed your team would reach really high battle speed numbers, ensuring
                            you act first.</li>
                        <li>Teal (Null Dark). Due to his amazing natural resistances, Null Dark would mean he'd

                        <li>Speedster. If not purple and you'd like the skill anyways its still a valid choice on
                            him. A fair investment though as it is 10 skill points and requires you to fuse Kama
                            (or if you're lucky have a Teal pulled Rakshasha).</li>

                            archetype switching to him as Energy Drain is lackluster. Mana Aid makes him really
                            good in pve, essentially you'd wipe out waves with Brahmastra, regain your mana, rinse

                        <li>Purple (Ice Pierce + Ice Age). The only source of ice pierce, being gacha exclusive.
                            Though you'd want to spam Brahmastra, ice pierce would laugh in the face of 5 elements

                            support and damage. Concentrate would allow you to use him in Jack Bros setups whilst
                            Luster Candy would give you another source of buff all (Though that's better suited to

                    <p>The opposite of a tanky demon as instead of surviving as long as possible she'd prefer to die
                        due to her unique passive Yaxche. This activates only on the enemy turn and has the effect of
                        when she dies: her killer is hit by an almighty attack (100 power) and is killed with a 100%
                        success rate. This bypasses Endure/Avatar/Enduring Soul, Tetraja and Seiran's Null Mortal, but
                        doesn't activate if her team is wiped out/she's the last one to die. On offense you can easily
                        exploit the game's AI to target her by intentionally leaving her at level 1, or having the
                        least defense/hp/mdef so they're tempted to kill her straight away.</p>

                                    blocking her ability.</li>
                                <li>Use ailments on her/her team. Poison can kill her without worry of her passive,
                                    charm can force her allies to kill her.</li>
                                <li>Bring Reiko as you'd probably expect them to use Recarm a lot. This will ensure

                            can function as a ailment caster to be an annoyance to the enemy team. Insanity complements
                            this and levelling up her passive also increases her ailment infliction rate. Give her
                            other ailments and she can pile them on the enemy team.</li>
                        <li>Purple (Berserker + Auto-Rakunda). Berserker, usually bad (+10% damage dealt, +20% damage
                            taken) is good in her case as you'd want her to Die For Me. Auto-Rakunda also adds onto
                            this making the enemy team worry more about their defenses at the start of the match. You
                            can technically build her for magic if you want as berserker would make her hit harder. She

                        Rebellion and a unique passive "Arms Mastery" (+15% phys damage/phys hit rate) making him
                        effective at hitting his target without any problems or repercussions from reflected
                        attacks. Given he naturally has Rebellion, he's also good when paired with Zaou Gongen,
                        granting him phys pierce when he uses it.</p>
                    <p><strong>Best Archetype(s): </strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Red and Yellow is decent but not that useful.</li>
                        <li>With Red (Titanomachia + Great Aim), Siegfried already has good accuracy so Great Aim
                            wouldn't do that much and you can always transfer something like Hades Blast instead
                            for damage.</li>
                        <li>Yellow (Charge + Auto-Sukunda), Charge is nice but you'd waste a lot of turns setting
                            up both charge and rebellion. Auto-Sukunda is good but again his accuracy is already
                            pretty good, that auto skill can be used from Yatagarasu anyhows.</li>
                        <li>If however you want to go with accuracy stacking then Red is best for the job, maxing
                            out Titanomachia would help in hitting evasive demons such as Garuda and Yatagarasu.
                            Since an aoe is given to you, you have two free slots to customize with whatever you
                            want. If you run him in a Hell Biker setup, then you don't even need to worry about
                            getting Savage glee for crits. Auto-sukunda from yellow would help for turn one wipes
                            (meaning you don't have to bring a Yatagarasu yourself), whilst Great Aim would help in
                            more accuracy in general.</li>
                        <li>Purple (Enduring Soul + Myriad Arrows). Adds to his survivability. Myriad arrows is
                            also nice for bosses, though people prefer to just give him an Aoe instead.</li>
                        <li>Teal (Null Force + Resist Dark). The main reason i'm recommending this is that it makes
                            him completely immune to Susanoo as it blocks all of his sources of attacks. It can
                            also block Rangda's Mazandyne and since a lot of demons have force in their kits in the
                            first place it can shut down a lot of sweeps. Resist Dark can be replaced.</li>

                        Has pretty high health, vitality, agility meaning he's pretty good at tanking. Also is

                            wouldn't need another demon just for auto-taruka. His other archetypes aren't that good

                        Berserker God and two unique skills: Meslamtea (+20% accuracy and casts rebellion whenever an
                        enemy is poisoned), Pague of Babylon (Casts Barrier Break then Weak all with 80% infliction
                        rate). With these two unique skills he can also be paired with Zaou Gongen to give his attacks
                        a pierce effect. You'd use him to remove barriers first then inflict weak on enemies, once
                        they're weakened they can easily be poisoned which results in him getting Rebellion. You'd want
                        an aoe skill on him of course in order to sweep.</p>

                        <li>Purple can be decent with Auto Taraka and Strength Amp III, but you can always bring along
                            other demons to Tarukaja your team anyways. There are a good amount of sources that come
                            with it, and skills as well.</li>
                        <li>Red (Hades Blast + Savage Glee). A -1mp Hades Blast is really nice on him and paired with
                            Savage Glee, without Rebellion he is really likely to crit. This also removes the need to
                            transfer an aoe onto him, so you can cover his weakness and either leave it at that or
                            replace Savage Glee with whatever you like.</li>
                        <li>Yellow (Toxic Sting + Auto-Sukuka). Toxic Sting naturally complements his passive. Assuming
                            the enemy has no barriers, you can Toxic Sting them, poison them then have Rebellion casted
                            on yourself and rinse and repeat. Auto-Sukuka helps in landing hits and increases evasion
                            too so that's always a plus.</li>

                    <p>Demon that can be built to be tanky due to his resistances whilst using Teal (He resists all but
                        ice and elec and is weak to dark, Teal gives him Repel Phys). His base kit consists of
                        Maragidyne, Mazandyne and Ce Actis' Return (unique skill). It acts in the same manner as
                        Recarmdra except the user doesn't die. However its coded to behave like Samarecarm so Quetz
                        will try to cast it as soon as he sees at least one ally dead (so you can take advantage of the
                        AI in that regard). Mainly used for pvp and when paired with Alilat (and being Teal) he can
                        stop phys sweepers from taking down your team and bring them back to life when they fall too.</p>

                    <p>Demon designed and built for tankiness (Third highest hp/vitality in game) with two unique
                        abilities centering around weaknesses: Law of Hell prevents the enemy team from getting extra
                        press turn icons when a weakness is hit, whilst Hell's Gate grants damage reduction depending
                        on the number of weak attributes your team has (3% per weakness, max 30%). Naturally he comes
                        with War Cry for debuffing and 2 weaknesses himself, meaning by default you get a 6% damage
                        reduction bonus (though this applies only to aoe/multi-target skills). Pairing him with
                        Hecatoncheires would grant you an extra 15% damage reduction and if you don't cover Hecaton's
                        weakness then in total they share 27% damage reduction. So if you do cap out on damage
                        reduction (by bringing demons such as Slime, Abraxas, Arahabaki, etc) you'd get a total of 45%
                        damage reduction, halving all damage done by the enemy. With this strat however, single target
                        skills will still do standard damage to you.</p>
                    <p>There are counters to Orcus teams:</p>

                        <li>Use Chalk Eater as your dx2, you'll still get buffs when you hit their weakness so you
                            don't have to bring a buffer unit. There's also the chance of getting extra press turns</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Best Archetype(s): </strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Red is quite bad to switch/shift archetype into (Mamudoon) as Orcus isn't really meant to
                            be a dps (he has a meh magic stat anyways). Auto-Tarunda is a really good skill though, so
                            if you pulled him as Red, i'd recommend switching to another archetype, keeping
                            Auto-Tarunda.</li>
                        <li>Purple can have its uses (Tetra Shift + Hell Gaze), it can stop first turn phys, giving you
                            one turn of breathing room, though in higher pvp people generally bring pierce phys demons
                            anyhows. Hell Gaze is pretty bad using the same reasoning as Mamudoon.</li>
                        <li>Yellow (Nocturne + Null Bind). Gives him another supporting skill to use to enhance your
                            team's defense and evasion. Coupled with the Tarunda effect from War Cry, once both buffs
                            are up you'll be taking quite miniscule aoe damage. Null Bind is okay, but can be replaced
                            if you desire to do so.</li>
                        <li>Teal (Null Phys + Vitality Amp III). Makes him immune to phys attacks which is really good
                            in pve, in pvp it can have its uses as well for blocking damage from phys demons such as:
                            Siegfried, Seth, Zhong Kui, Shiva (provided he doesn't Pralaya), Yoshitsune. When facing a
                            Hell Biker team, you may be able to survive long enough for all 3 uses of Red Zone wear
                            off, making him immune to their team, as they are oriented towards aoe phys.</li>

                        useful in Vanity 10 where the final boss there is Quetzacoatl with Mazandyne and Maragidyne.
                        Naturally he also comes with Auto-Rakuna and Vanaha (+15% evasion, +30% ailment resistance)
                        further solidifying those points before. Given the ailment resistance boost he'd have low

                        Biker defense teams, with the highest agility in game + the bonus to evasion, he should be able
                        to easily dodge phys attacks. Take Yellow for Fog Breath and somehow get sukukaja onto your
