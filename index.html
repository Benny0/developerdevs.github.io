                <h4 style="text-align: center;">Azuraki's Notes on Demons</h4>
                <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>This is a guide for all 5★ demons in the game when you want to fuse them/archetype change. </li>
                  <li>Its focus is in analyzing and discussing what are good/bad archetypes
                      and is based on looking at their kit + how the playerbase generally builds them.</li>
                  <li>There may be people who have better opinions than mine as I don't have that many 5★ demons.</li>
                  <li>For Gacha demons, i'll go over their gacha skills as the only way to obtain them is via pulling</li>
                  <li>Standard 5★s are analyzed on the basis of the archetype skill only, for when you want to fuse them/switch archetype</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>4★ (and below) demons</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Notable demons are now included in the guide. All gacha 4★ and lower demons are covered, whilst with fusables i've selected a few to go through </li>
                  <li>I will only discuss the best/usable archetypes for these. Bad archetypes should essentially be considered to be sold for Karma/fused away </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Brands</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Refer to the <strong>"Guide: Brands"</strong> by Dev, for brand setup information (this guide will just list general setups for each demon).</li>
                  <li>If i don't list a secondary brand, go with Ward.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Archetype Rating</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Worst =</strong> The other archetypes are mostly better than this one</li>
                  <li><strong>Usable =</strong> Could have its uses depending on the sort of build you want to run</li>
                  <li><strong>Best =</strong> Considered the most optimal, most suited to the demon/build people generally go for</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Terminology</strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>ndr =</strong> Null, Drain, Repel. Immunity to a specific element</li>
                </ul>
                <!--
                <li><strong>Gacha Skill Rating: (WIP)</strong>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Bad = Could easily be replaced, not worth transfering to another demon</li>
                      <li>Acceptable = Usable on the demon, but can be transferred away/replaced if you want it on another demon</li>
                      <li>Keep = Recommended to hold onto the skill, it works well on the demon</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                  <p>This Mini Guide serves as both to answer frequently asked questions and give some useful information for newer players</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Skills:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Makara Break:</strong> Removes both Makarakarn and 5 Elements</li>
                    <li><strong>Silent Prayer:</strong> Removes Tetrakarn, Makarakarn, 5 Elements, Lydia, Charge, Concentrate, Ailments, Might(Rebellion) effects for all demons</li>
                    <li><strong>Lydia:</strong> Is not affected by Healing Amount% or Mag% boosts from brands. It heals 15% per demon's turn, activating 3 times.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ce Acatls' Return:</strong> Has the same AI behaviour as Samarecarm, <strong><a href="javascript:void(0)" @click="show_guide_devil('Quetzalcoatl')">Quetzalcoatl</a></strong> will use this even when there is only one demon defeated</li>
                    <li><strong>Endure/Enduring Soul:</strong> Will activate in the order which you transferred them to the demon (If you have multiple). 
                      <br>E.g. <strong><a href="javascript:void(0)" @click="show_guide_devil('Vishnu')">Vishnu</a></strong> with Enduring Soul in slot 5 and Endure in slot 6 
                      will activate Avatar first, followed by Enduring Soul, then Endure last</li>
                    <li><strong>Repel Phys/Repel Magic (Makarakarn/Tetrakarn/5 Elements):</strong> Do not stack on top of eachother, if already have one reflect shield and cast another, it'll replace it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Healing:</strong> Affected by both Mag% and Healing Amount%, Tarukaja has no effect on it.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p><strong>Stats:</strong></p>

                  <p><strong>AI:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Attack:</strong> Focused on using damage skills, they won't use Support skills at all</li>
                    <li><strong>Support:</strong> Focused on using support skills (Buffs/Debuffs), they can use healing (mainly when multiple demons are injured, if one is badly injured they won't use it) and attack skills</li>
                    <li><strong>Heal:</strong> Focused on healing/revival skills. If a demon is even scratched, they'll likely heal up that injured demon. I haven't seen Heal AI demons use Support skills at all however</li>
                    <li><strong>All types:</strong> Have an exception when it comes to revive skills (Recarm/Samarecarm/Recarmdra/Ce Actl's Return). If they have the mp for it and see a fallen ally they will use it</li>
                    <li><strong>All types:</strong> Prioritize hitting weaknesses and being able to finish off an enemy over their base behaviour. In pvp if they see a level one demon, they'd likely just target them with a basic phys attack unless they can aoe phys</li>
                    <li>Programmed so that they cannot use the same skill multiple times in a row. A Divine branded demon with a 4mp skill would break out of the 0->4->0 cycle if their skill is used multiple times in a row</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p><strong>PVP:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Starting first:</strong> Each demon begins with 2mp. Great for when you want to run an ailment oriented team. Remove barriers via Barrier Break/Plague of Babylon/Silent Prayer then inflict the enemy team with all the ailments that you can</li> 
                    <li><strong>Starting second:</strong> Each demon begins with 5mp. You can take advantage of demons with high mp costs like Quetzalcoatl by having Tetra-Shift they're forced to attack into it (if you start out second)</li>
                    <li><strong>Defense Team:</strong> The Dx2 you assign will only have their stat increase passives apply to your team. Seiran will grant +12 Ag (+1200 Battle Speed), Eileen with 10% Max HP and +7 Lu, etc. 
                      <br>Stat bonuses will not show up on the battle speed screen and so be sure to remember Seiran always gives 1200 Battle Speed, Kangaroo Boxer 700, and MC 300.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p><strong>Counter Passives:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Regardless of whether the demon hit has ndr phys or the attack missed, if they're targeted by a phys attack counter will activate</li>
                    <li>Is activated on hits, if a demon with counter is hit twice, the passive is procced twice</li>
                    <li>If a demon has multiple counter passives, only one will activate per hit. 
                      <br> E.g. <strong><a href="javascript:void(0)" @click="show_guide_devil('Ose')">Common Ose</a></strong> with counter, either counter/retaliate will activate or neither of them(never both)</li>
                    <li>Doesn't crit, miss or generate press turns</li>
                    <li>Not affected by Charge/Rebellion</li>
                    <li>Affected by the opponents resistances, target will take no damage if they null/repel phys and will be healed if they drain it. If they repel it, it is treated as a null</li>
                    <li><strong><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Dx2SMTLiberation/comments/9ok8t3/useless_psa_how_counters_work/" target="_blank">Source</a></strong> (Thanks to eli1323 on Reddit)</li>
                    <li>Pierce affects counters, given the previous point counters will ignore the opponent's resistances (unless they're paired with Alilat/Rama)</li>
                    <li>Affected by Phys Boost/Amp, increasing demon's PATK would increase its damage</li>
                    <li>Meat Balloon can increase counter damage and increase the chance for counters</li>
                  </ul>

                <button class="DG-CollapsibleButton" onclick="toggleCollapsible(this)">Archetype Shifter/Selector</button>
                <div class="DG-Demon"><br>
                  <p>Introduced as another option for spending Karma, Archetype Shifting/Selecting allows you to change the archetype of a demon from one 
                    color to another (excluding Common archetypes), the result is always a different archetype. <br> Shifters/Selectors can be found in the exchange 
                    store either via the PvP screen (Exchange) or Pandemonium (Sell Demons -> Exchange) and can also be obtained via events/mission rewards.
                  <br> When a demon's archetype changes, only their awakened skill is updated (skill 4), skills in slot 5/6 are untouched unless it is their new awakened skill. For example:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong><a href="javascript:void(0)" @click="show_guide_devil('Vishnu')">Yellow Vishnu</a></strong> with Level 2 Megidolaon in slot 5 (nothing in 6) and we
                        want to change him to Red.</li>
                    <li><strong>Case 1:</strong> He is Awakened, the result would have <strong>Level 2 Megidolaon</strong> (slot 5 and 6 empty).</li>
                    <li><strong>Case 2:</strong> He was not Awakened, then the result would have <strong>Level 1 Megidolaon</strong> (slot 5 and 6 empty)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>So if you want to change archetype and already have a levelled version of the skill on the demon, be sure to Awaken the demon before hand</p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Types:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Archetype Shift</strong> chooses a random archetype to change into (E.g. If your demon is Red, then it'll become either Teal/Yellow/Purple).</li>
                    <li><strong>Archetype Select</strong> gives you the option to choose the resultant archetype.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p><strong>General Usage (Shifters):</strong></p>
                  <p>If you want to shift a demon, it's recommended to be prepared for when you don't get the desired archetype. 
                    <br> To give an example: A <strong><a href="javascript:void(0)" @click="show_guide_devil('Ananta')">Red Ananta</a></strong> that we want to try shifting to Purple. 
                  </p>
                  <img src="images/guides/ShiftExample.png">
                  <p><br>Above are the possible fusion results that Ananta can create, if the resultant archetype is:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Purple:</strong> Keep Ananta for usage</li>
                    <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Fuse into either Huang Long (Usable), Zaou-Gongen or Garuda</li>
                    <li><strong>Teal:</strong> Fuse into either Quetzalcoatl, Lilith, Asherah, Huang Long, Barong, Susano-o or Shiva</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>This way you maximise the usage of the shifter so it doesn't go to waste, the case can happen where you shift from one color to the other and then back to the original.</p>
                </div>
                
                <!-- [Support Demons] -->
                <button class="DG-CollapsibleButton" onclick="toggleCollapsible(this)">Support Demons</button>
                <div class="DG-Demon"><br>
                  <p>In game you are able to choose a demon to set as support, enabling others to use your demon in Story, Brand and Aether farming. Support demons are controlled by the AI and will 
                     always act last regardless of their speed in comparison to your own (I believe they also have no effect on battle speed). In the case of running levelling quests (two parties), the support demon 
                     will appear twice, once for your first team and once for your second (if your first team falls), in both situations the demon starts off at full health/mana and if effective enough could carry your team.
                     <br> A support demons usage refresh once everyday during the daily reset. It also refreshes for every hour you re-login, so to maximise your demon's usage, re-login every hour and clear those who have been 
                     inactive on your list.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Setting your support demon:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Open up the Menu at the bottom right and select "Party", going to the party screen</li>
                    <li>Select "Support Demon" on the bottom left hand corner to change your demon</li>
                    <li>Whatever demon you see there is the current support demon in use</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Support demon recommendations:</strong></p>
                  <p>When it comes to choosing which sort of support demon to assist others, the general recommendation is to set one that is offensive. Depending on the type of demon you choose, 
                    there are also some caveats in the way you build them that can determine how effective they'll be. Support/Healer demons aren't that desired as the main party should have that avenue covered, more 
                    damage is always good regardless of the situation.

                  <p>Each stat has a cap of a +10 bonus and depending on the rarity of the demon there is also a limit for the total amount of stat points that can be boosted. 1★ demons can be boosted in every stat to 10 (limit of 50) and 
                  as you go higher this limit decreases restricting the amount of points you can allocate. Choose wisely when it comes to investing specifically in 4/5★ demons

                  <p><strong>Sample builds</strong></p>
                  <p>Investing +10 to a stat can help quite a bit depending on the stat invested in. For example if you compare Mastema and Amaterasu, they both have the same Agi stat when maxed out. If you want either to 
                    act first you can simply boost up their Agi to ensure better turn order. In any demon which you've invested any Agility Amp I/II into, Infusion is a great replacement for it, freeing a slot to use for 
                    another skill. 
                  <br> The best stat to invest into for any demon would be Luck (increases accuracy, evasion, crit chance, ailment resistance, ailment infliction and reduces chances to receive crits), followed by Agi for 
                  turn order, accuracy and evasion. Vit would be great for more tankiness and Mag/Str provides a minor boost to damage/defence but is still good for maxing out their potential.
                  <br> Below are some sample stat spreads, you can follow it if you wish or go with whatever you like.

                  <p>In case you want to remove stats gained through Infusion, the <strong>Purge</strong> feature can do so (also found in the Pandemonium). To purge a demon, you need to use the relevant <strong>Purge Extract</strong> 
                    which can be purchased in the Black Market (accessed from Hideout). One Ag Purge Extract would remove 1 infused Ag point, St Purge Extract would remove 1 St point, the same applies to the rest of the extract types. It is randomized 
                    in the store, but you can purchase 3 at a time for ~2,000 macca.

                <div class="DG-Demon"><br>
                  <p>To be attempted only when you're satisfied with your main demons as it takes extra investment into demons you may not normally use. These challenges test your 
                  demon building ability and for the reward you are granted titles to show off. They have restrictions pertaining to grade, requiring you to finish it without any continues and so if you break 
                  them then you won't get the title unlocked upon clearing the stage.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>1. Grade Limit:</strong> Each party is limited based on their total grade.
                      <br>E.g. Grade Limit of 10: 
                      <br><strong>Team 1 =</strong> 
                          <strong><a href="javascript:void(0)" @click="show_guide_devil('Mokoi')">Mokoi</a></strong> and 
                          <strong><a href="javascript:void(0)" @click="show_guide_devil('Agathion')">Agathion</a></strong> (5+5)
                      <br><strong>Team 2 =</strong> 
                          <strong><a href="javascript:void(0)" @click="show_guide_devil('Melchom')">Melchom</a></strong> and 
                          <strong><a href="javascript:void(0)" @click="show_guide_devil('Chagrin')">Chagrin</a></strong> (4+4)
                      <br>This setup is valid, but if you replace any with <strong><a href="javascript:void(0)" @click="show_guide_devil('Koppa Tengu')">Koppa Tengu</a></strong> 
                          (5+7 or 4+7), it would be over the limit.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>2. No Continues:</strong> Clear the stage without using Gems to revive your team.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p><strong>Tips and Recommendations:</strong></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>You can use items, be sure to do so as they'd come in handy for reviving, healing and curing ailments. Reflect mirrors can also help in making your foes lose press turns.</li>
                    <li>For the later stages (40 and 50), it is recommended to start off the battle with a secondary team. Buffs/Debuffs will carry over when you switch teams so auto-buffs/debuffs would be useful on the get go.</li>
                    <li>Both <strong><a href="javascript:void(0)" @click="show_guide_devil('Jack Frost')">Yellow Jack Frost</a></strong> and 
                             <strong><a href="javascript:void(0)" @click="show_guide_devil('Pyro Jack')">Yellow Pyro Jack</a></strong> 
                        will prove very useful in the later fights. Tag allows your main damage source to spam many attacks and if you bring a weakness hitting demon + use Chalk Eater you'd get 
                        buffs in the process (also gaining chances to gain extra press turn icons). Their total grade value is 20 (7+13), so if you only want to run one then Jack Frost is the cheaper demon.
                    </li>
                    <li>The suggested Dx2s to use is Seiran for your sub team and Chalk Eater for your main team. Start off the floor as Seiran for a free scan of the floor (helps you reach the boss easier), Chalk will be for taking advantage of weaknesses.</li>
                    <li>In the later floors, you'd require demons with Aura Gate trap related passives, preventing the effects of Damage Tiles and Dark Zone Tiles when figuring out the path to the boss</li>
                    <li>You can skip encounters by closing the app then reopening it, it'll place you back on the tile you were standing on before you started combat. If you were in the boss fight you'll immediately refight it from the beginning.</li>
                    <li>Hare of Inaba's unique passive "Trap Free" gives you the Void Dark Zone effect and damage reduction from Damage Panels (-30%). If you transfer Dmg Panel VI (-25%) and Dmg Panel VII (-50%), you can get immunity to 
                    both negative tile effects in the one demon. I've done so for my Hare and so my general secondary team for 40 and 50 consist of mainly Hare + other demons.</li>

                              <br>Simply pick one that you like, level it to 45 and it shouldn't be that much of a problem.
                              <br>Even though he comes to Makarakarn, all i've seen him spam is Fog Breath and Hamadyne.

                              <br>Like Dantalian i've mainly just seen him using his attack skills.

                            <p>Tag and Weakness hitting spells would still work wonders for this stage. Baphomet will mainly spam Mamudo with the occasional Maragi and so be sure 
                            to heal up with Beads in case things go awry. Having Ice should take care of both Dakini and Light is takes care of Baphomet.

                            <p>With the boosted grade limit, a low grade demon won't cut it anymore. Slime likes to favour Life Drain over Megaton Raid and luckily it doesn't do much damage, so 
                            if you use a demon with Drain Phys, you should be able to heal up the damage to taken from the skill (Repel to make him take more damage).

                            <p> The toughest challenge yet compared to the others. There is only one strategy that we've figured out so far and it involves using a gacha only demon sadly.
                              Start off the battle with your sub team containing <a href="javascript:void(0)" @click="show_guide_devil('White Rider')">White Rider</a> and hit both Alice and Asherah with
                              God's Bow. If it fails even once you'd have to reset the fight as they both need to be down in order for this to go smoothly. Required battle speed is >16,701, so pairing White Rider with a speedy demon 
                              is mandatory to start off first (+ 1200 from Seiran helps).
                              
                              <br><br>Once they're down, White Rider + your speedster would likely fall, leading to your main team. <a href="javascript:void(0)" @click="show_guide_devil('Huang Long')">Huang Long</a> + 
                              whatever you like should be able to handle the rest of the fight. 5 Elements will reflect all of Metatron's moves, so then all you have to do is rely on healing yourself up via items 
                              if your team gets too badly bruised. Huang Long is Grade 88, so you have 62 left to pick from.

                    <p>Dark oriented unit with Mamudoon, Mudodyne and her unique Die for Me! (DfM) (Kills a single enemy,
                      one use only). Yup, she can kill anyone she points her finger at and so she's really good for shutting down dangerous
                      opponents and can hit hard provided they don't have dark immunity as that's all her base kit relies on.

                        <li>Having a ndr Dark unit, the skill needs to land to activate</li>
                        <li>Using Tetraja (Patrimpas/Mishaguji), this prevents Mortal (instant kill skills), though DfM will do damage in this case</li>
                        <li>Using Makarakarn/5 Elements, walling off all of her damage sources. Though you can run Makara Break/Silent Prayer to also remove reflect shields</li>
                        <li>DfM does not go through endure/enduring soul/avatar. So if a demon is hit by it and has that skill, they'll still survive.</li>

                    <p>The opposite of a tanky demon as instead of surviving as long as possible she'd prefer to die for me due to her unique passive Yaxche. 
                        This activates only on the enemy turn as when she dies: her killer is hit by an almighty attack and is killed with a 100%
                        success rate (same effect as White Rider/Alice). This bypasses Endure/Avatar/Enduring Soul, but doesn't activate if her team is wiped out/she's the last to die. 
                        On offense you can easily exploit the game's AI to target her by intentionally leaving her at level 1, or having the least 
                        defense/hp/mdef so they're tempted to kill her straight away.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are counters to her ability if you ever see her on defense teams:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Kill all other demons and leave her last. </li>
                                <li>Use Huang Long's special ability: 5 elements as this repels almighty attacks,
                                    blocking her ability.</li>
                                <li>Use ailments on her/her team. Poison can kill her without worry of her passive,
                                    charm can force her allies to kill her.</li>
                                <li>Bring Reiko as you'd probably expect them to use Recarm a lot. This will ensure
                                    Ixtab's ability only activates once as she should be easily killable </li>
                                <li>Tetraja via Patrimpas or Mishaguji can block her ability as well. 
                                    I do feel Huang Long would be better in this regard, but if you don't have him they're good alternatives.</li>

                    <p>Mot is a tanky caster coming with Megidolaon, Mamudodyne and Harmonius Death, a really useful passive (Every second turn he gains 
                       10% damage (cap = 50%) and an extra press turn). Naturally he repels Force and Dark, meaning if you pair him up with Alilat you can prevent 
                       Cu Chulainn + Black Frost sweeps. Given his unique passive, stats and the fact he also resists 
                       phys and fire he's a really good defensive demon in pve and pvp content. The longer he's left alive, the more 
                       dangerous the enemy team becomes. Note it takes two turns for a 10% jump and so it'd take 10 
                       turns to reach 50%. This is unlikely to be reached in pvp but in pve content such as Kiwami this can prove quite useful depending on who 
                       you go up against.

                    <p>Demon designed and built for tankiness with two unique abilities centering around weaknesses: Law of Hell prevents the enemy team 
                       from getting extra press turn icons when a weakness is hit, whilst Hell's Gate grants damage reduction depending on the number of weak 
                       attributes your team has (3% per weakness, max 30%). Naturally he comes with War Cry for debuffing and 2 weaknesses himself, meaning by 
                       default you get a 6% damage reduction bonus (though this applies only to aoe/multi-target skills). Pairing him with Hecatoncheires would grant 
                       you an extra 15% damage reduction and if you don't cover Hecaton's weakness then in total they share 27% damage reduction. 
                       So if you do cap out on damage reduction (by bringing demons such as Slime, Abraxas, Arahabaki, etc) this brings it up to a total of 45% essentially halving all 
                       damage done. With this strat however, single target skills will still do standard damage to you.</p>

                        <li>Use Chalk Eater as your dx2, you'll still get buffs when you hit their weakness so you
                            don't have to bring a buffer unit. There's also the chance of getting extra press turns</li>

                    <p>One of the most OP demons in the game, hats off to you if you've obtained him. He has no weaknesses: Null Phys, Resist Light, Drains Dark (He can't be killed by Alice), 
                       the highest strength in the game and really high luck (meaning he can easily crit, have high innate ailment resistance and infliction) and a really powerful 
                       base kit. Vorpal Blade for phys aoe, Warlord's Wrath: Granting phys pierce, 100% phys counter and Intimidating Stance all in one passive and Occult Flash: Single 
                       target phys damage with 50% crit, 200 power and 100% kill rate. Yup even if you have Tetraja on your demon, odds are they'll die anyways from the heavy damage and crit (even has three uses). 
                       Since he's a intimidating stance user, it's best to pair him up with another stance user. I'd recommend Zhong Kui due to his Auto-Taruka having a huge benefit for the both of them.
                       <br> One interesting thing is that counter can be prevented if the unit is bound (credit to itzmeAkA on Reddit). 
                            Against Masakado himself, you can then safeguard your phys units through bind (be wary of his high innate ailment resistance though).

                    <p>Bayonetta from the Bayonetta series is a collaboration event character oriented towards criticals and charm. She has no elemental weaknesses, Mortal Jihad for single 
                      target phys attacks and two unique abilities (one passive, one active). Madama Stomp (Passive) activates whenever she lands a critical hit, comboing with an almighty attack 
                      that has a chance to inflict charm (can be levelled, adding ailment infliction % and critical %), whilst her second ability: Gomorrah (B) is a single target skill and as amazing as it sounds, 
                      has a three turn wait and one use, so it's best to save it up for bosses. 
                      
                      <br> With quite low hp and vit stats she can fall quite easily, so its kill or be killed unless you pair her up with nice support units that buff/debuff, heal and revive. She can work 
                      amazingly with the standard Hell Biker + Zaou Gongen combo as with the guaranteed crit and pierce she can attack, activate her passive and pierce phys at the same time.

                        <li><strong>Madama Stomp:</strong> Only activates once per action regardless of the skill used. 
                          If a multi-hit skill or aoe crits multiple targets then out of the enemies hit by crits, the leftmost target will be hit by Stomp.</li>
                        <li><strong>Madama Stomp:</strong> If she crits herself or an ally demon (provided she's charmed), it will activate on the leftmost opposing demon surprisingly.</li>
                        <li><strong>Gomorrah (B):</strong> Will tick down whenever it is her turn. If she's dead then it won't tick down.</li>

                    <p><strong><a href="javascript:void(0)" @click="show_guide_devil('Jeanne ☆')">Demon Information</a></strong></p>
                    <p>Collaboration event character, Jeanne from the Bayonetta series is built similarly as a mirror to Bayonetta, they both have the same stats and resistances, 
                      except St and Ma being flipped meaning Jeanne is naturally more magic focused. Jeanne is Bind oriented and can combo off Bayonetta's charm passive (and any charm source in general). 
                      Hades Blast gives her an innate phys aoe (though her strength stat is not that high), Madama Uppercut (passive) allows her to hit charmed foes with an almighty attack (also having 
                      a chance to bind them in the process, can be levelled to grant bonus ailment infliction % + evasion %) and Gomorrah (J) enables her to wipe once three turns is up, for sweeping as opposed to Bayonetta's 
                      version for boss killing.
                      
                      <br>She is also fairly squishy just like Bayo and instead would pair well with any charm inflicting demon such as Lakshmi, Man Eater and Mother Harlot. When Mother Harlot's passive activates, 
                      Jeanne's will too, leading to some bonus damage at the start of the battle (though it's limited to the leftmost demon if multiple are charmed). 
                      In pvp a lot of people use ward, Infernal/Hellish Mask and Null Charm so this is moreso for pve such as levelling quests and AG where it's possible to inflict charm on foes.
                      
                      <br><br> When it comes to her skills, here are the facts we know:
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Madama Uppercut:</strong> Only activates once per action regardless of the skill used. 
                          If a multi-hit skill or aoe charms multiple targets then out of the enemies charmed, the leftmost target will be hit by Uppercut.</li>
                        <li><strong>Madama Uppercut:</strong> Will be activated by Mother Harlot's Death Lust </li> 
                        <li><strong>Gomorrah (J):</strong> Will tick down whenever it is her turn. If she's dead then it won't tick down.</li>
                      </ul>

                        party members. This means she's useful for setups with demons such as Purple Thor (Elec

                       This is because of her unique skill Repel Pierce, ignoring the pierce effect on units that repel the attribute. 
                       She is easy/cheap to fuse, has no weaknesses and really high luck + Infernal Mask meaning she can inflict ailments quite well and be 
                       unlikely to be inflicted herself. Due to this you have a lot of freedom in picking how you want to build her, whether a debuffer, ailment caster, 
                       or even a healer role from what i've seen.</p>

                        sniping skill (getting 20% damage based on Phys Attack). It will take a lot of investment, but you can get Ragnarok
                        to rain down the norse apocalypse on enemies (It's one of the most powerful skills in the game, 215 base power). With brands 
                        prioritized towards Matk %, Phys% secondaries, a maxed out Ragnarok (5 Kasanes required), you can reach pretty high numbers with him.

                        Recarmdra except its user doesn't die. This is coded to behave like Samarecarm so Quetz
                        will try to cast it as soon as he sees at least one ally dead (so you can take advantage of the
                        AI in that regard). Mainly used for pvp and when paired with Alilat (when Teal) he can

                     Whever a enemy is weakened, he casts Sukunda and inflicts poison on them. To synergize, Nergal happens to have an ability which removes barrier then inflicts 
                     weak + a passive which casts rebellion whenever an enemy is poisoned making them a powerful combo. Even without Nergal he can work fine by himself, you need to 
                     inflict weak on enemies or just inflict poison for a free Sukunda. Mad Gasser (comes with Mahapoisma, poison all) can pair well with him as you can always 
                     transfer Madezoreto (weak all) to him too.

                    <li>Agility Amp I/II/III. Most of the time Yatagarasu is a good pairing as he comes with Auto-Sukunda (also being a pretty good phys attacker). The problem with this is that Yatagarasu 
                        will act before HB meaning he won't get that effect. One way to get around this is transferring any of these to ensure HB has more agility, going first (or use Lead Brands).</li>
                    <li>Phys skill. If you want Hell Biker to be attacking with skills himself, be sure to save enough mp for Red Zone casts though when your team needs it</li>
                    <li>Mana Aid. Expensive to transfer but if you get Mana Aid for him he can immediately crank out Red Zone every wave (assuming you only need 1 per wave)</li>                    
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Brands: </strong>Divine for quick Red Zone casting. You need to max out the skill in order to turn one use it in pvp.</p>

                  <p>Like Bayonetta, she also as a more inferior 4★ version (also having mirroring stats to Bayonetta, with flipped St and Ma, meaning she's a spell unit). 
                  Without her unique skill and passive she has Hades Blast (which is bad on her), Berserker and Soul Drain. Compared to 4★ Bayo, with her stat spread i'd recommend building 
                  her to magic instead if you want to use her, so in pve she should focus on Soul Drain + any transferred spells.

                  <p> Bulky slow demon with resist phys, null force but two weaknesses. Though this is detrimental, the reason why he's recommended isn't for pve but instead pvp against intimidating stance teams.
                      He comes with Berserker God, Rakukaja and his unique passive: Faith in Wealth (Increases his max hp and recovers 1mp to your team whenever you lose a press turn icon). When facing off against IS teams,
                      you then start off an extra two mp (7mp or 8 if using Divine), quickly sweep the enemy team and hopefully do enough damage to win. Since IS teams mainly revolve around Phys/Fire, you technically don't have to worry about 
                      covering his glaring weaknesses, it's always nice to do so anyways.

                    <p>Sturdy slow demon with good hp/vit and luck. For pvp he's a auto-debuffer with Auto-Tarunda (his other two skills are quite useless) and shines as Yellow 
                       for the sole purpose of spamming Fog Breath. If you want a replacement demon, Purple Ananta works better in this regard. Having both Auto-Tarunda and Auto-Rakuka cast
                       at the start of pvp battles can save your team from being swept by teams, giving them a fighting chance at counter attacks.

                    <br>He's really squishy and so will fall very easily to magic, having one of the lowest HP/Vit/Magic stats in the game, quickly wipe them out before they can wipe 
                    you out. Due to this Yatagarasu souls also litter AG 45-50 floors and so you shouldn't waste Yasaka Magatamas on him.

                     Oni-Kagura to strike with a boosted crit chance and Auto-Taruka giving your team an immediate boost in attack at the start of combat.
                     In retrospect he has low HP, Mag, Vit and Agi meaning he can have trouble hitting (luck is factored into hit rate but with low Agi it's balanced out). 
                     Best seen with Purple Archetype for pvp he's suited towards slow teams (to intentionally aim to start second). Combine him with Surt or Baihu for double intimidation

                  <p>Mainly used in pvp offense when you want a good counter towards 2x Intimdation stance teams running heavy phys units,
                    Chupacabara is generally left at level 1 so that you can purposely outslow the enemy team. Coming with Auto-Sukuka and Mazan (for 
                    clearing Endures), his passive Stealth gives him a 20% boost to evasion once it activates (is essentially Endure + Evade combined into one) also giving him an extra life. 
                    Stack evade % on him and be sure to have Sukukaja/Sukunda up as much as possible and watch them try to hit him, wasting their press turns.

                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Terminology</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Primary Stats</strong> are the first stat listed on the brand.</li>
                        <li><strong>Secondary Stats</strong> are the second stat listed on the brand.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tertiary Stats</strong> are the third, fourth and fifth stats listed on the brand.</li>
                        <li>For lack of a better word, I will define <strong>Type</strong>&nbsp;as the categorical body
                            part that the brand represents: Head, Right Arm, Left Arm, Body or Legs.</li>
                        <li>Likewise, the term <strong>Set</strong> will be the category that decides what set bonus
                            the brand will give. (Divine, War, Spell, Ward, Aim, etc.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>First things first, let's analyze an example brand:</p>
                    <table style="height: 20px; width: 1500px;">
                        <tbody>

                        <td style="width: 1400px;">&nbsp;
                        <ul>
                        <li>Looking at the brand, we can see the following:
                        <ul>
                        <li>The primary stat is HP, and adds 114 HP to your demon.</li>
                        <li>The secondary stat is Mag DEF, and adds 42 Mag DEF to your demon.</li>
                        <li>The tertiary stats are Accuracy, Phys ATK and Critical, and add 7% accuracy, 12% physical attack and 2% critical chance to your demon.</li>
                        <li>The brand set is War, and will add 20% Phys ATK when paired with two other War brands (For a total of 3 War brands in the set)</li>
                        <li>The brand type is Head. Head brands will always have flat HP as their primary stat, so we have to look at tertiary stats for bonuses to a Physical Attacker's offensive capability.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The primary and secondary stats of this brand add FLAT stats, while the tertiary stats add PERCENTAGE bonuses to your stats.</li>
                        <li>Upon first glance, this brand would be well suited for a Physical Attacker.
                        <ul>
                        <li>12% Physical Attack will land many Physical Attackers around ~80-100 extra Physical ATK points.</li>
                        <li>7% Accuracy helps the Physical Attacker land more physical attacks, which can be very important as missing loses press turns.</li>
                        <li>2% Critical is a nice bonus to the Physical Attacker's critical rate, but really the first two tertiary stats are the ones to pay attention to.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li>Tertiaries could be any stat, they could be one of the 5 flat stats (HP, ATK, DEF) or any
                            of the percentage stats.

                                <li>Brands at level 1 could start with 0, 1, 2 or 3 tertiaries.</li>
                                <li>Flat tertiaries start from anywhere from 1-25 at level 1, and can boost up to 50 points</li>
                                <li>Percentage tertiaries start from anywhere from 1-4% at level 1, and can boost up to 20%</li>
                                <li>Tertiaries cannot be the EXACT same as the primary stat, so if the primary stat is a Phys ATK % for example, a tertiary for that brand will not be Phys ATK %</li>
                                <li>Aim for brands starting with 1 or 2 decent tertiaries. (1 for usable brands, 2 for

                                <li>6★ Brands starting with 3 tertiaries are unicorns (rare). Don't feel the need to
                                    chase them, especially since brands with 2 tertiaries have a chance to be just as
                                    good.</li>
                                <li>In many cases you would want percentage tertiaries, but not always. (Explained in a

                                <li>At level 3, if the brand does not have at least 1 tertiary stat, then a tertiary
                                    stat will be generated.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Otherwise, one of the brands existing tertiary stats will be boosted. (This is the only way to get tertiaries above 5%)</li>

                                </li>
                                <li>At level 9, if the brand does not have all three 3 tertiary stats, then a tertiary
                                    stat will be generated.

                                        <li>This means, that if your brand starts with 3 tertiaries at level 1, it is
                                            possible for the same tertiary to be boosted at levels 3, 6, and 9. This
                                            would push a percentage stat really high (Probably 12%+)</li>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li>This means that if you want to optimize your 6★ brands tertiary stats, they
                                            must be leveled to 15.</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>As we can see, the reason why you would want at least 1 or 2 decent tertiary stats at level
                            1 is because of the tertiary boosts at levels 3, 6, 9 and 15.&nbsp;<br />
                            <ul>
                                <li>A brand with a tertiary stat, for example, of Phys ATK +3% at level one could end
                                    up with that tertiary being Phys ATK +12% at level 15 due to these boosts.</li>

                                        <li>I kept this brand because the two tertiaries matched up well for Physical

                                <li>At level 3, the Phys ATK tertiary was boosted from 4 to 8%.</li>

                                <li>At level 15, the Phys ATK tertiary was boosted again, from 8% to 12%.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Phys EV: </strong>Increases evasion rate - Decent due to innate high

                                I've sold all my bad brands and I don't have enough macca to level a bad one up lol.

                                                    <li>So if you cannot get a good Phys ATK tertiary, getting a Phys ATK
                                                        secondary would yield 42 Phys ATK at level 15 (Which is equivalent
                                                        to about 5.6%)</li>

                                            <li>Ideally, I'd actually want Mag DEF as the primary stat.
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>Mag DEF is more useful because we Yoshi already has high innate AGI
                                                        and boosted evasion from the other brands</li>
                                                    <li>Magical Attacks cannot be evaded, which means we need some other
                                                        way of mitigating that type of damage</li>

                                            <li>If we're nitpicking, we'd probably want Accuracy as a tertiary to replace

                                                be Phys or Mag DEF, you might as well try and land a useful tertiary that

                                                skill that can come with Yoshi, or can be transferred from Teal Orochi
                                                (Gacha skill as well) it can be pretty substantial.</li>

                            <li>The War brand set bonus gives an additional 20% which translates to 149 more Physical ATK
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Brings the total up to a boost of 893.5 Physical ATK, which should give Yoshitsune
                                        a total of 1638.5 Phys ATK.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>The game seems to round this up to 1640, which means that there seems to be
                                                a hidden float value for each stat.</li>
                                            <li>My guess is that Yoshi doesn't have just 745 PATK, but rather 745.5 or
                                                something.</li>

                            </li>
                            <li>The Ward brand set bonus also gives a 3-turn barrier at the start of the battle</li>
                            <li>Anyways, this is what I'd call a decently optimized Physical Attacker, here are the primary
                                points:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>3 Brands with Phys ATK % primaries</li>
                                    <li>Decent, usable tertiaries that cover focus stats (Especially Accuracy)</li>
                                    <li><strong>To improve:</strong> Mag DEF is on the low end, and maybe Yoshi could use more Accuracy</li>
